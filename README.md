# OpenSource Contributions Tracker

OpenSource Contributions Tracker is a powerful and easy-to-use tool designed to help developers and organizations keep
track of their open-source contributions. Whether you're contributing to multiple projects or managing a team of
contributors, this tool provides a centralized place to monitor your progress, celebrate milestones, and showcase your
impact on the open-source community.

## Features

The tool is designed to track and report contributions to open-source projects on GitHub for one user or a group of
users. It generates detailed reports on commits and pull requests made by users across various repositories and
projects.

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches commits and pull requests from GitHub repositories.
- **Data Processing**: Aggregates and processes the data to provide meaningful insights.
- **Report Generation**: Creates markdown reports with summary tables and pie charts.
- **Automated Execution**: Can be scheduled to run periodically using GitHub Actions.

## Demo

A sample report generated by the tool can be found [here](output/github_contributions_report.md).

## Local Setup

To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NihalJain/opensource-contributions-tracker.git
    cd opensource-contributions-tracker
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1. **Set up environment variables**:
    - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token.
    - `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`: (Optional) Proxy settings if required.

2. **Input Data File**:
    - The input data file should be a JSON file located at `input/github.json`.
    - This file should contain the following structure:
        ```json
        {
            "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
            "users": ["user1", "user2"],
            "project_to_repo_dict": {
                "Project1": ["repo1", "repo2"],
                "Project2": ["repo3"]
            }
        }
        ```
    - where
        - `start_date` is the date from which to start tracking contributions
        - `users` is a list of GitHub usernames,
        - and `project_to_repo_dict` maps project names to their corresponding GitHub repositories.

### Usage

1. **Generate the report**:
    ```sh
    python generate_github_contributions_report.py
    ```

2. **View the report**:
    - The report will be generated in the `output` directory as `github_contributions_report.md`.

## Github Actions (Automated workflow)

- **GitHub Actions**:
    - The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the report generation.
    - The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml` and is scheduled to run every 24 hours.
    - No need to manually trigger the report generation; it will run automatically based on the schedule defined in the workflow.
    - You can check the status of the workflow in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository.
    - You can also manually trigger the workflow if needed.
  
- **Updating the Workflow**:
    - If you need to update the workflow, you can modify the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file as per your requirements.

- **Update the github.json file**:
    - In order to update the user/rrepo list configuration, you can modify the `input/github.json` file as per your requirements.
